881	Dutch wholesale marketplace Orderchamp raises €16.6 million to expand further across Europe	Dutch scale-up Orderchamp, a fast-growing wholesale marketplace for brands and retailers, has raised around €16.6 million in growth capital for further expansion in Europe, only two years after its inception. The Series A round is led by Prime Ventures, which previously invested in JustEat-TakeAway.com (TKWY), amongst others. Existing investors henQ and several business angels also participated in the round. Thousands of retailers use Orderchamp’s platform to discover and buy from more than 1,800 European brands easily. Brands, in turn, gain access to 30,000 retailers from all over Europe through the platform. With its favourable purchasing conditions, such as low order minimums, 60-day payment terms and free shipping, Orderchamp has supported thousands of independent retailers in times of crisis. In addition, due to the absence of trade fairs, brands get the opportunity to create new business relationships and benefit from a guaranteed payout on every order. “The majority of the investment will be used to increase our international footprint, improve the digital purchasing experience, and further develop our powerful technology including machine learning and integrations with commerce systems,” said co-founder and CEO Joost Brugmans. “Our retailers visit our platform several times a week to source unique products for their store or webshop. That is why we pursue adding dozens of new brands daily rather than weekly, which retailers can purchase quickly and easily. Based on previous sales data of tens of thousands of retailers, we can better predict whether a product will sell in that particular store. This way, our stores can continue to stand out from the crowd and strengthen local retail.”	<triplet> Orderchamp <sub> €16.6 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Prime Ventures <sub> €16.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> henQ <sub> €16.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> business angels <sub> €16.6 million <obj> INVESTS

3743	SendCloud raises €2 million to create one unified European shipping network	Back in 2012, the cost- and time-inefficient of ecommerce shipping has inspired three friends with an online store to launch SendCloud. The Eindhoven-based startup offers a cloud-based shipping software, which enables online stores to operate more efficiently and ship goods at competitive rates. The three founders, who are determined to create a unified European parcel delivery network, just received a €2 million investment led by Dutch investment firms TIIN Capital and Brabant Development Agency. The European shipping market is highly fragmented, even international delivery companies offer limited ecommerce connectivity. Rob van den Heuvel (CEO of SendCloud) explains: “Imagine a Dutch online retailer with an order from Spain. The shipment will cost about €15, not to mention the costs and inconvenience of return shipments”. For online shops it is difficult to service international customers. Market leaders have the means to make custom-made arrangements with shipping providers. Smaller shops do not have these possibilities. SendCloud offers unique shipping software for small and medium-sized companies. Partnerships with a large range of shipping providers such as DHL, PostNL and UPS, allow the company to optimize the end-to-end shipping process for their customers.	<triplet> SendCloud <sub> €2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> TIIN Capital <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Brabant Development Agency <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS

The funding will support Taxdoo’s rapid growth through international expansion, increased hiring, R&D, sales and customer support. As consumers continue to move online, e-commerce in Europe is forecast to exceed€700 billionin 2020 with cross-border transactions now representing approximately25%of the total and rising. In response, hundreds of thousands of businesses are turning to Amazon, eBay, Shopify and a wide array of other platforms to sell internationally. However, as they do, they are facing increasing complexity around VAT, accounting and other compliance requirements, with data siloed across multiple online systems. With cross-border e-commerce posing challenges to traditional domestic taxation, governments are focusing on indirect taxes such as VAT as a key source of income. However, fraud and inadequate tax collection is expected to result in €164 billion of VAT revenue leakage acrossEurope in 2020, which is driving governments to increase legislation for e-commerce. Ninety percent of the resulting burden for online businesses consists of collecting, preparing and reviewingcompliance-related transaction data.	<triplet> Taxdoo <sub> €17 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Accel <sub> Taxdoo <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Visionaries Club <sub> Taxdoo <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> 20VC <sub> Taxdoo <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> HTGF <sub> Taxdoo <obj> INVESTS

1222	Spanish insurtech startup Bdeo secures €5 million digitalise the insurance claims industry	Bdeo, a leading insurtech company in Spain and Latin America, has just closed a Series A round of funding worth €5 million. The fundraising was led by BlackFin, a European investment firm focused on financial services, with further support from current investors K Fund and Big Sur Ventures, who invested €1 million in Bdeo’s seed round in 2019. The new funding will help consolidate Bdeo’s position in the markets where it currently operates as part of its plan to become leaders in visual intelligence in the insurance sector by 2022. The insurance industry is an attractive market for venture capital, with the startup highlighting that over €800 million was invested in European insurtech companies in 2019 alone. Nevertheless, according to a recent study byastorya.vc, much of this investment has been made in companies focused on distribution, while only a small part has been directed to companies whose technology improves the operational performance of insurance companies by reducing the impact of fraud or by digitising their processes.	<triplet> Bdeo <sub> €5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> BlackFin <sub> €5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> K Fund <sub> €5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Big Sur Ventures <sub> €5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Big Sur Ventures <sub> €1 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Bdeo <sub> €1 million <obj> RECEIVES

Founded in 2016, Vinterior opens up the world of vintage and antique furniture to both trade and consumer buyers everywhere, enabling them to discover and purchase unique, high-quality, characterful pieces through its online marketplace.

The fresh capital will be used to build out the team, accelerate product development and expand the customer base. Shipamax is on a mission to fix the ship booking experience for transporting bulk commodities Booking a ship for bulk commodities today is still a rather slow process. Data is siloed, making it hard to work as a team, and shipowners and brokers receive in excess of 5,000 emails daily. Administrative costs are pretty high with room for error every step of the way. According to Shipamax, the price of booking a bulk ship has dropped by about 90% since 2008 and has not recovered since – putting strain on the industry to cut costs and become more data driven. As a result, ship brokers are under increasing pressure to prove they are still relevant and can add value to the booking process. In addition, shipowners must use all the data they have to improve return on their assets as banks tighten access to capital.	<triplet> Shipamax <sub> $2.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Cherubic Ventures <sub> $2.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> AME Cloud <sub> $2.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> FF Angel <sub> $2.5 million <obj> INVESTS

Further new investors include Slack Fund, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, Framer CEO Koen Bok, Elastic Co-Founder Simon Willnauer, Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel, Wunderlist-backer Frank Thelen, and Metalab Founder Andrew Wilkinson. Presentations have defined entire industries, architected how organisations function, how work itself is shaped and how information and knowledge is conveyed throughout markets and societies. They impact the lives and businesses of hundreds of millions of users every day, with billions of hours spent on crafting and delivering presentations. Yet the tools widely used today have remained more-or-less within the same paradigm since many years. The existing tools are sometimes a bit complex, sometimes do not integrate with external data sources and have limited collaboration features. Pitch is here to change that. Started in January 2018 by the founding team behind Wunderlist, the leading to-do app which was acquired by Microsoft in 2015, Pitch is using modern web technologies, data integrations and team-oriented features to empower true collaboration. Pitch aims to make it significantly faster and easier for impactful presentations to be created and shared – both by individuals and teams.	<triplet> Pitch <sub> $19 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Index Ventures <sub> $19 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> BlueYard <sub> $19 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Slack Fund <sub> $19 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Eric Yuan <sub> $19 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Koen Bok <sub> $19 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Simon Willnauer <sub> $19 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Olivier Pomel <sub> $19 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Frank Thelen <sub> $19 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Andrew Wilkinson <sub> $19 million <obj> INVESTS

2840	Dutch solar rental startup Solease raises €3 million from New York investment fund	Solease‘s vision is to cover all the rooftops in the Netherlands – and eventually the world – with solar panels. But not everyone can afford to install their own solar panels on their roofs. Instead, the Utrecht-based company leases solar panels to homeowners and businesses for a fixed monthly amount, which includes the costs of the purchase, installation, insurance and repair. This way, homeowners and businesses can immediately install solar power without any upfront investment – and at a price that is often more affordable than current electricity costs. Solease says that on average, its customers save two tons of CO2 per year – equivalent to 20,000 car kilometers or the annual absorption of 100 trees. The startup hopes to install an additional 150,000 solar panels in the next five years. Founded in 2011, Solease just raised €3 million from the New York-based Arosa Capital Management. This comes just a few weeks after the company raised €2 million via crowdfunding. So far, Solease has raised a total of €17 million from investors, regional energy funds, and crowdfunders.	<triplet> Solease <sub> €3 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Solease <sub> €2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Arosa Capital Management <sub> €3 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> crowdfunding <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS

3225	Munich-based Blickfeld secures €3.6 million in seed funding to let autonomous vehicles “see”	The Munich-based startup Blickfeld today announced the closure of a €3.6 million seed funding roundled by Fluxunit – OSRAM Ventures, High-Tech Gründerfonds, Tengelmann Ventures and Unternehmertum VC. Founded in 2016, Blickfeld has developed a unique light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology that basically enables autonomous vehicles “to see”. Autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars, robots, and drones, need to “see” and “understand” the world around them to safely navigate and operate. Blickfeld develops LiDAR systems by using a proprietary technology that creates high-definition, three-dimensional geometric maps. In the automotive industry, LiDAR is considered one of the decisive technologies towards autonomous driving. The focus of Blickfeld is on bringing high-performance automotive LiDAR systems to the mass market. By using commercial off-the-shelf and silicon components, the startup has developed and demonstrated a unique technology that can be produced in low-cost mass fabrication and meets the technical performance specifications required by car OEMs. This is achieved by employing a patent-pending scanner technology which merges the best of both silicon microfabrication and already established LiDAR concepts. This advanced approach closes the gap between today’s high-cost systems and the automotive mass-market needs, and thus enables safe and affordable autonomous transportation.	<triplet> Blickfeld <sub> €3.6 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Fluxunit <sub> €3.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> OSRAM Ventures <sub> €3.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> High-TechGründerfonds <sub> €3.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Tengelmann Ventures <sub> €3.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Unternehmertum VC <sub> €3.6 million <obj> INVESTS
