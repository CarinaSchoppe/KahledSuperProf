3130	Stockholm-based Anyfin secures €4.8 million to save consumers money on existing loans in seconds	Anyfin, a Stockholm-based fintech startup that enables consumers to refinance their existing loans with a picture, just closed a €4.8 million Series A funding round led by Accel and Northzone. Global Founders Capital and angel investors, including consumer finance executives and international fintech entrepreneurs, also participated in the round. At the point when a loan is originated, lenders have very little access to information about a consumer – particularly around repayment history – and often have a monopoly over their distribution channel. Consequently, many consumers with good credit scores are being overcharged for money they borrow. What is more, the process to refinance existing loans through traditional banks or brokers requires a lot of paperwork and can take weeks. By leveraging more publicly available consumer data and by using AI and modern mobile technology, Anyfin enables consumers to refinance their existing loans within seconds simply by taking a picture of their loan statement. Consumers send Anyfin the picture through a channel of their choice, like SMS, email or Facebook Messenger, and the company replies with an option to refinance the loan at a better price. With one tap, the consumer accepts the new option from Anyfin, and the company takes care of settling the existing loan for them. Aside from a better price, the terms of the new loan mirror those of the existing loan.	<triplet> Anyfin <sub> €4.8 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Northzone <sub> €4.8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Accel <sub> €4.8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Global Founders Capital <sub> €4.8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> angel investors <sub> €4.8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> consumer finance executives <sub> €4.8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> fintech entrepreneurs <sub> €4.8 million <obj> INVESTS

The Series B funding round had been led by venture capital firm Index Ventures, while existing investors Accel, Creandum, and Project A also participated. Digital healthcare is a fast-growing sector in many countries.

1897	Paris-based Flitdesk closes €1 million seed round to make running a flexible workplace simpler	French startup Flitdesk has announced closing a €1 million seed funding round to launch its flexible workspace management platform out of beta. The round was led by prominent angel investors like French businessman Xavier Niel, through his fund Kima Ventures. Flexible workspaces have become the new normal over the past ten years with the growth of remote work, coworking, and hot desking. Companies are trying to design offices adapted to the needs of a flexible workforce. But flexible workspaces are much harder to manage than conventional offices, and unfortunately the toolkit that is available to workplace managers has not evolved much (think: spreadsheets, calendars, post-its) for the last 20 years. Managers need the right tools to boost employee productivity and engagement. That is where Flitdesk comes in. Flitdesk was founded in 2017 to provide an all-in-one solution to workplace managers in their quest for more flexible workspaces. As the brainchild of Julian Dufoulon and Youenn Laumelais, the two had realized that smart buildings should be designed around the needs of users, not the the building infrastructure itself. A typical design brief for a modern workplace includes taking into consideration highly mobile and nomadic work habits, shared group settings, diverse task-based spaces, and variable occupancy periods (sometimes very high).	<triplet> Flitdesk <sub> €1 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Kima Ventures <sub> €1 million <obj> INVESTS

It basically means that the whole industry pumps money into a black hole and waits months to find out the results. However, the correlation between what people search and sales numbers and market share has been scientifically proven.

Earlier today the mobile payment companies SumUp and payleven announced a merger agreement. A few hours later we learned that the Munich-based fintech startup Paymill seems to be in trouble, as it has just entered into a “strategic” insolvency. Like payleven, Paymill has been heavily backed from the beginning by Rocket Internet. The Berlin-based company builder seems to have bad luck currently – especially in the fintech industry. Founded in 2012, the online payments provider Paymill raised a total of roughly €18 million in venture capital from Rocket Internet, Sunstone Capital, Blumberg Capital and Holtzbrinck Ventures. Rocket Internet and the other investors have not officially commented on Paymills current problems yet, but it seems as if they were not interested to provide Paymill with further capital. I just had a call with Paymill founder Mark Henkel, who explained that the current problems were caused by an acquistion which almost happened but was canceled after a lot of time was already invested into discussions and due diligence. Another reason for the current situation is that it took longer as expected to get a bank license for Paymill, which you need if you want to operate a online payments service at the scale of Paymill.	<triplet> Paymill <sub> €18 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Rocket Internet <sub> €18 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Sunstone Capital <sub> €18 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Blumberg Capital <sub> €18 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Holtzbrinck Ventures <sub> €18 million <obj> INVESTS

3626	Mobile banking fraud prevention system by Number26 receives subsidy from IBB	Number26, the Berlin-based fintech startup which created a mobile-first bank account, is receiving a €700K subsidy from the Pro FIT program of the Investitionsbank Berlin (IBB) for the development of fraud prevention systems. These systems rely on split-second artificial intelligence and transaction data to detect and preventfraud before it can even take place. According to Card Fraud report 2015, fraud affects about ,04% card transaction value in the EU. In other words, every €10.000 of card revenue comprises about €4 of fraud. This cost can be significantly reduced through smart software designed to detect it. NUMBER26 is planning to make card transactions safer worldwide. With support from subsidy mentioned above the company is going to further research and develop new fraud prevention system. It will use artificial intelligence to analyze factors like spending history, movement patterns and merchant data to prevent fraud before a transaction is booked. For example, if a MasterCard is stolen and later used, a situation-specific scoring takes place which is used to prevent fraudulent transactions. The system learns from each successfully-blocked transaction and thus becomes ever more intelligent.	<triplet> Number26 <sub> €700K <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Investitionsbank Berlin <sub> €700K <obj> INVESTS

Channel 4 Ventures and Rider Global, as well as existing investors Cherry Ventures, bp ventures, Partech, Version One and Forward Partners also participated in the round. Many people argue that the COVID-19 pandemic is changing the way cars are consumed and sold. As appetite for flexible solutions grows, Drover aims to shape the future of car retailing by building a new type of ‘car-as-a-service’ platform that streamlines the traditionally fragmented and dealership-based process of buying, financing and insuring a car into a simple online transaction. Founded in 2015, Drover has delivered record results in its consumer business during a period when traditional car sales had nearly halted completely. While in May only 13,000 new personal cars were registered in the UK, down 89% from last year, Drover more than doubled the number of new subscriptions sold compared to a year ago – finishing Q2 with a record high in revenue. Drover’s completely digital model has been particularly appealing as customers are looking for a more flexible, modern alternative to car ownership in a time of significant uncertainty and a deep economic downturn.	<triplet> Drover <sub> €22.6 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Target Global <sub> €22.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Autotech Ventures <sub> €22.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> 4 Ventures <sub> €22.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Rider Global <sub> €22.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Cherry Ventures <sub> €22.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> bp ventures <sub> €22.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Partech <sub> €22.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Version <sub> €22.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Forward Partners <sub> €22.6 million <obj> INVESTS

Our technology allows companies to switch from a business approach to a competency approach by identifying, in real time, all the skills of their employees. Integrated into operational processes, eLamp becomes the processor of the competency data and the foundation for all processes: staffing, HR and certifications/authorizations”.	<triplet> eLamp <sub> €2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> MySeedCap <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> BPI France <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> BNP <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> CIC <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Business Angels <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS

3423	Meet the Slovenian startup which helps you keep your shirt tucked in and makes you look professional throughout the day	Ok, this one is not exactly a tech startup, but still an interesting young company with an innovative product. The Slovenian company NV came up with an new solution for men to keep their shirt tucked in throughout the day. Think about how often you have to tuck your shirt back in during a long day in the office or on the road. With the new NV S-Holder, this problem now gets solved. The brand name is a bit tricky, since it is pronounced almost like ass-holder. But still: It is an interesting product! The S-Holder basically works like upside down suspenders. They clip to your shirt to keep it weighed down. Such S-Holder sets are available for $38 and can be shipped worldwide. To be fair, NV might not be the inventor of this concept, but with their design and crowdfunding approach they make this type of solution accessible to a young audience of men. NV currently does a 2nd crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. They already raised $70,700 and the campaign will run for another month. The first campaign also was successful and was set up to create the previous version of the product, called T-Holder. For more info regarding the current crowdfunding campaign for S-Holder, check out the video below:	<triplet> NV <sub> $70,700 <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Kickstarter <sub> $70,700 <obj> INVESTS

3301	UK-based machine intelligence chip maker Graphcore secures $30 million in a funding round led by Atomico	The Bristol-based Machine intelligence company Graphcore just announced a $30 million Series B funding round, led by Atomico. The fresh capital comes as the company prepares to ship its first Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) hardware to customers later this year, with scale-up production for enterprise datacentres and cloud environments in 2018. The Series B round is dedicated to accelerating roadmap development and building a community of developers and partners around the company’s Poplar graph framework software, establishing Graphcore as the leader in the market for machine intelligence processors.

Siraj Khaliq, the Atomico Partner who will join the Graphcore board of directors, stated: “It is clear that machine intelligence will sit at the heart of the technological leaps we will see in this coming chapter of human history – a process already well underway. Graphcore’s first IPU delivers one to two orders of magnitude more performance over the latest industry offerings, making it possible to develop new models with far less time waiting around for algorithms to finish running. In that sense, the IPU does not just accelerate code, it should help developers accelerate the pace of innovation itself.”	<triplet> Graphcore <sub> $30 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Atomico <sub> $30 million <obj> INVESTS

This increases pressure on an already strained care system. Birdie is addressing this crisis by reinventing care for older people, partnering with care providers to support the ageing population in living healthily and happily at home for longer. Birdie’s intuitive and easy to use app is the operating system for care providers to efficiently deliver more coordinated, personalised and preventative care.	<triplet> Birdie <sub> €9.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Index Ventures <sub> €9.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Kamet Ventures <sub> €9.5 million <obj> INVESTS

No need to waste your time parallel parking or looking for a free space. The robot takes care of everything for you. The car is then ready and waiting upon your return. The robot itself is completely autonomous (Automatic Guided Vehicles) and adapts to different environments and weather conditions. Aurélien Cord, CTO and Co-founder of Stanley Robotics, explains: “Beforehand, we were working in a research lab developing autonomous vehicles. Stan is the product of 15 years of research in this field. Today we are extremely proud to be able to make this technology available to the general public.”	<triplet> Stanley Robotics <sub> €3.6 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Elaia Partners <sub> €3.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Idinvest Partners <sub> €3.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Bpifrance <sub> €3.6 million <obj> INVESTS

With this new app, F3 satisfies the current young generation’s needs — 85% of the audience is below 25. Forced to stay at home, people worldwide escape from social exclusion through different apps. But in their attempts to liberate themselves from loneliness, people fall into another trap — multiple studies have shown a link between social media and feeling more lonely, depressed, and anxious, including about one’s life or appearance, fear of missing out etc. Generation Z, which is more than 2 billion people worldwide, most often suffers from the adverse effects of social platforms and is searching for a more honest communication method.	<triplet> F3 <sub> €3.2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Mail.ru Group <sub> €3.2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Adfirst VC <sub> €3.2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Alex Hofmann <sub> €3.2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Marat Kichikov <sub> €3.2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> F3 <sub> €3.2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> F3 <sub> €3.2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> F3 <sub> €3.2 million <obj> RECEIVES

The round was led by Speedinvest, a leading early-stage industrial tech investor, with participation from Force Over Mass. The new funds will be used to further develop and scale Greyparrot’s solution across global markets, setting the company up to revolutionise the recycling industry with artificial intelligence. Only 14% of waste is recycled, due to inefficient recycling systems, rising labour costs, and strict quality requirements imposed on recycled material. On a global scale to date, 60% of the 2 billion tons of solid waste produced each year ends up in open dumps and landfill, causing major environmental impact. Additionally, less than 1% of waste is monitored and audited, as this expensive manual process is difficult to scale and provides little insight into facilities. Greyparrot, founded in 2019, provides AI-driven waste recognition software to monitor and sort waste at scale. Their first product, an Automated Waste Monitoring System, is currently deployed on moving conveyor belts in sorting facilities to measure large waste flows. The system automatically identifies different types of waste, providing composition information and analytics to help facilities increase recycling rates.	<triplet> Force Over Mass. <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Speedinvest <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Greyparrot <sub> €2 million <obj> RECEIVES

Investors also include Mark Logan, ex-COO at Skyscanner, who has joined the company as a board member. The Edinburgh startup, which was founded in 2014, will use the fresh capital to expand its engineering team and further develop its product following early customer traction. The vacation rental market has ballooned over the last decade and is expected to be worth $193bn by 2021 with the growth of large B2C players such as Booking.com and Airbnb driving the market for so-called ‘alternative lodging’. However the market is enormously fragmented, with property hosts needing to advertise on over 40 booking sites – from online travel agents and pay per listing sites to local listings and flash sale sites such as Groupon and Secret Escapes – to maximize occupancy. As a result, 56% of holiday rental dates go unsold in the UK and property owners are missing out on €42k of lost revenue per property each year. Doug Stephenson, the founder and CEO at TravelNest commented: “This is a real headache for holiday rental hosts.

2505	London-based social impact fintech startup Wagestream raises €46 million for its service to end payday poverty	London-based fintech Wagestream is a flexible wage app, fighting against payday poverty to end the financial stress caused by the monthly pay cycle by allowing staff to draw down a percentage of their earned wages any day of the month for a flat fee of £1.75 – with no loans or interest. The firm sealed its Series A round this week for a total of €46 million, led by early-stage VCs Balderton and Northzone. Wagestream is on a mission to end in-work poverty, eradicate payday loans, and destroy the ‘Poverty Premium’, whereby people on low incomes pay more for a range of essential products and services such as insurance, energy, and credit. Wagestream is doing this by short-circuiting the monthly pay cycle — an antiquated monthly windfall that forces workers into the hands of payday lenders and other high-cost lenders when they approach the end of the month or face unexpected expenses.	<triplet> Wagestream <sub> €46 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Balderton <sub> €46 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Northzone <sub> €46 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Wagestream <sub> €46 million <obj> RECEIVES

Several angel investors (…Michael Brehm, Heiko Hubertz, Felix Haas, Stefan Glaenzer…), Greycorp, Point Nine Capital, Digital Pioneers N.V., H2 Investments and YoungBrains invested in Kreditech earlier in 2012. In total Kreditech has now raised $4 million, which, according to CEO Sebastian Diemer, will be sufficient to scale the B2C business to break-even in Q1 2013. In addition, Kreditech plans the international (European) launch of its B2B product “Scoring as a Service” in 2014.

Location data (GPS, micro-geographical), social graph (likes, friends, locations, posts), behavioral analytics (movement and duration on the webpage), people’s e-commerce shopping behavior and device data (apps installed, operating systems) are just some examples of up to 8,000 data points that are processed in real-time for any single scoring unit. This technology is applied in B2C markets for issuing online / SMS / facebook microloans (e.g. www.kredito24.pl and www.kredito24.es) in real-time as well as for the establishment of a global “Scoring as a Service” database that provides scoring data without technical integration or contractual obligations to third parties (e.g. banks, leasing companies, e-commerce stores).	<triplet> Kreditech <sub> $4 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Kreditech <sub> $4 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Blumberg Capital <sub> $4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> management of a German investment bank <sub> $4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Point Nine Capital <sub> $4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> angel investors <sub> $4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Greycorp <sub> $4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Point Nine Capital <sub> $4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Digital Pioneers N.V. <sub> $4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> H2 Investments <sub> $4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> YoungBrains <sub> $4 million <obj> INVESTS

2074	Stockholm-based Detectify secures €21.5 million to bring world-class cyber security to everyone	Detectify, a Swedish web application security startup, has today announced its latest financing round of €21.5 million. The series B round was led by venture capital firm Balderton Capital, and supported by existing investors Paua Ventures, Inventure and Insight Partners. The new funding will be used to continue to hire world-class talent to further accelerate the company’s growth and deliver on Detectify’s promise of a safer internet for all. Detectify was founded in 2012 by a group of elite Swedish ethical hackers who set out to give every company the same level of security as the world’s largest software companies and Government security services. Detectify does this through ‘Detectify Crowdsource,’ an invite-only ethical hacker network. This network allows top-ranked security researchers to submit vulnerabilities which are then built into the Detectify automation platform, combining the best of human ingenuity with machine learning to provide security. This Detectify Crowdsource network has experienced rapid growth, with the community modules having already found 110,000+ vulnerabilities in Detectify’s customers’ assets in the last eighteen months. The ethical hackers are paid every time their submitted module identifies a vulnerability on a customer’s web apps. As each reported vulnerability could help Detectify secure hundreds of web apps through automation, ethical hackers in the Crowdsource network have a much broader impact than in traditional, manual ‘bug bounty’ programmes, which only benefits a given player.	<triplet> Detectify <sub> €21.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Detectify <sub> €21.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Detectify <sub> €21.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Detectify <sub> €21.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Detectify <sub> €21.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Detectify <sub> €21.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Detectify <sub> €21.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Detectify <sub> €21.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Detectify <sub> €21.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Balderton Capital <sub> €21.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Paua Ventures <sub> €21.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Inventure <sub> €21.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Insight Partners <sub> €21.5 million <obj> INVESTS

The round is being led by Atlantic Food Labs, with the participation of Market One Capital and the company’s initial investors, Seedcamp and Mustard Seed MAZE. Kitch launched a year ago, in March 2020. Upon launching the startup was focused on enabling everyone in the city to have the dishes from their favourite restaurants at home while allowing these restaurants to serve the city from kitchens designed especially for food delivery services. As part of their offering, Kitch started developing its own proprietary technology to make the most out of delivery. As the pandemic pushed most European countries into prolonged lockdowns, restaurants were forced to shut their doors and to focus their efforts on the increasingly digital spaces of food delivery and take-away. These extreme circumstances further surfaced the struggles of independent restaurants. The struggle to support the high fees charged by third-party delivery apps. The struggle to retain the relationship with their customers in the digital space. The struggle to have their food delivered, on their terms.	<triplet> Kitch <sub> €3.25 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Atlantic Food Labs <sub> €3.25 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Market One Capital <sub> €3.25 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Seedcamp <sub> €3.25 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Mustard Seed MAZE <sub> €3.25 million <obj> INVESTS

The funding will allow Morressier to accelerate its growth and launch new community and analytics features that will increase collaboration and foster an ongoing conversation around conference content. Across all fields, conferences play a pivotal role as the key place where knowledge and research findings are first shared. Yet valuable conference content often remains ephemeral, restricted to physical venues or computer screens and disappearing when an event ends. Unlike other virtual meeting providers, Morressier connects, indexes, and publishes all conference submissions in a digital library, ensuring this content can be accessed long-term and can reach an expanded audience beyond the initial attendees. Sami Benchekroun, Managing Director and Co-Founder of Morressier, said: “The past year saw an unprecedented shift to the online realm and highlighted the importance of providing better ways to meet and exchange content, particularly in vital verticals such as medicine and R&D. At Morressier, we are harnessing this momentum to build a more accessible conference system, one in which all researchers can discover valuable content, build on each other’s ideas, and make progress faster.

The startup will use the funds to continue its work to build a reasonably-sized ‘fault-tolerant’ quantum computer. Founded in 2017, Quantum Motion is led by founders Prof. Simon Benjamin (Oxford University) and Prof. John Morton (UCL) and commercial director Dr. James Palles- Dimmock. The team is working on a patented technology (silicon spin-based qubit architectures) which, for the quantum computing experts out there, are compatible with standard CMOS fabrication and so provide easier scaling to thousands and millions of qubits. Importantly, this technology will be used to make a fully functional, fault tolerant, quantum computer, and also gives the near-term opportunity of easy integration in a hybrid quantum/classical computer. Co-founder Prof. Benjamin comments“There are many ways to create a quantum computer, but to achieve true fault tolerance and thus explore the deepest and most powerful algorithms, electron spins in silicon may prove to be the best – or even the only – practical solution”.	<triplet> startupQuantum Motion <sub> €9 million <obj> RECEIVES

4162	Social Video Ads: Unruly receives $25m in funding	Unruly, a global technology platform for social video advertising, today announced a $25 million Series A investment from Amadeus Capital Partners, Van den Ende & Deitmers and Business Growth Fund. The financing is probably the largest ever for a private company in the social video space and will be used to accelerate international growth and cement Unruly’s position as a global leader in this fast-growing area. With a revenue run-rate approaching $50 million (2011 full year revenue $25 million) and profitable since 2009, Unruly has 100 staff across nine offices (hq in London) and is doubling in size each year. The young company, which was founded in 2006, has delivered a number of high profile social video campaigns for global brands, including Evian’s “Roller Babies,” T-Mobile’s “Welcome Home,” Coca Cola’s “Happiness Factory” series and many more (check out the video below for an example). According to Unruly, social video campaigns across the industry generated 2.7 billion views in 2010, more than 8 billion views in 2011 and are predicted to generate 20 billion views in 2012. Brands and agencies have started to recognize the power of social video to make an emotional connection with their audience, influence consumers and ignite conversations. However, media fragmentation and device proliferation make it kind of difficult to do this at the scale they require. Unruly aims to solve this problem by providing a truly global media and technology platform for social video advertising that reaches 725 million people across 74 countries.	<triplet> Unruly <sub> $25 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Amadeus Capital Partners <sub> $25 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> VandenEnde&Deitmers <sub> $25 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Business Growth Fund <sub> $25 million <obj> INVESTS

Other investors to participate in the round are Possible Ventures, Kima Ventures, Quiet Ventures and Acequia Capital. The fresh capital will be used to expand its fully autonomous restaurant chain in France, and explore new locations in Europe. Cala has built the first fully robotic pasta restaurant in the world. The young company created a pasta-making robot to autonomously cook affordable, nutritious, sustainable and delicious meals, and transform the cost and experience of fast-casual dining. Founded in 2017 by engineering students, the idea for the company came from their own experiences in finding it hard to eat good quality and convenient food on a student budget and a belief that technology held the answer. Ylan Richard, Co-founder and CEO of Cala, said, “As students we were frustrated by the cost and lack of healthy meals available to us. Through our research, and driven by our own stomachs, we could see that the food service industry is broken. In fast food, the low-profit margin means that it is impossible to use higher quality ingredients. We realised that if you could automate the meal preparation, you could rapidly increase the number of meals being produced and improve the economics. We decided to focus on pasta as it can be customised and we could also reduce the number of meals that include meat, offering customers delicious food that is more sustainable, healthy and affordable. We have been building and iterating on our robot and our autonomous kitchen can now make 400 pasta dishes in one hour.”	<triplet> Cala <sub> €5.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> BACKED VC <sub> €5.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Possible Ventures <sub> €5.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Kima Ventures <sub> €5.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Quiet Ventures <sub> €5.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Acequia Capital <sub> €5.5 million <obj> INVESTS

Founded in 2015, Lyvly is a living community, that matches great housemates to quality homes. The company addresses the need for community, convenience and affordability in the urban rental experience. It is designed to remove pain-points for both landlords and renters, (who they refer to as members). The brand maximises the potential of the new and fast growing co-living trend, whilst working with existing housing stock, rather than purpose built blocks Individuals looking to move into a Lyvly home apply through the members’ committee, which consists of people from the existing community. Lyvly manages the whole experience for members, who pay one single monthly payment that covers the cost of rent, bills, cleaning, consumables and repairs. All Lyvly homes are fully furnished, right down to the teaspoon in the kitchen drawer. For landlords, Lyvly finds and vets high quality potential renters who stay for the long term, and provides them with property management services. Due to the community and members’ experience, Lyvly can offer landlords lower occupier turnover and therefore higher incomes as properties do not sit empty for any periods.	<triplet> Lyvly <sub> $4.6 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Mosaic Ventures <sub> $4.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Greg Marsh <sub> $4.6 million <obj> INVESTS

42	Changing the landscape of European VC to become more founder-friendly, London-based D2 closes fund at over €18 million	London-basedD2has today announced the close of its Fund I at over €18 million with the vision to create the most founder aligned venture capital fund in the world. The firm is offering startups terms that get cheaper for them the more efficient they end up being in their business. Investors in the fund include She Will Ventures, Mountain Labs, Bland Group, and a series of exited founders and VCs. D2 aims to improve the odds of success for founders – conscious of the fact that the path to success or failure for startups really depends on a solid growth path and efficient business models. The firm incentivises efficiency by offering cheaper and more flexible investment terms while providing access to a network of experts to help founders scale their businesses. With digitisation and massive leaps in software development companies today benefit from a set of digital rails that they can build their business on top of. The result is that it is never been faster or cheaper to iterate towards product-market fit. It brings about more optionality for startups. Software businesses no longer need to decide their destiny at the point of company formation, instead, they can stay lean early on and aim for Series A milestones on the back of limited external capital. At this point, they can decide on the best path forward armed with more knowledge of what makes the best business sense.	<triplet> D2 <sub> €18 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Bland Group <sub> €18 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Mountain Labs <sub> €18 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> She Will Ventures <sub> €18 million <obj> INVESTS

To support further product development and market expansion, smol has raised around €27.9 million in Series B funding led by Eight Roads Ventures with participation from Google Ventures, Latitude, and existing investors Balderton and Jam Jar. smol was founded in 2018 by two consumer product experts, Paula Quazi and Nick Green (both ex Unilever), with the goal of providing customers with a better alternative for their homecare needs. “We want to bridge the divide between big brand products that focus on affordability and efficacy, and smaller eco-friendly brands that are more expensive and less effective,” said co-founder Paula Quazi. By rethinking each part of the production process and selling directly to consumers, the team was able to create a product range that is sustainable, affordable, and effective, all delivered to consumers’ homes based on their individual usage patterns. The company started with laundry capsules and has since expanded to fabric conditioner, dishwash tablets, surface sprays, and most recently hand sanitiser. All products are manufactured with a lower carbon footprint, have reduced levels of added chemicals, and are vegan and free from animal cruelty. The laundry capsules and dishwash tablets come in a world-first 100% plastic-free pack which is 100% recyclable or compostable. The fabric conditioner is free from animal fat (unlike most big brands) and comes in bottles made with 100% recycled plastic that can be recycled or returned to the company for re-use. The surface spray bottles also use recycled plastic and are refillable for life – customers receive cleaning tablets that dissolve in warm water, eliminating the need for new plastic bottles and reducing the shipping footprint.	<triplet> smol <sub> €27.9 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Eight Roads Ventures <sub> €27.9 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Google Ventures <sub> €27.9 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Latitude <sub> €27.9 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Balderton <sub> €27.9 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Jam Jar <sub> €27.9 million <obj> INVESTS

LiFE Ventures, Toni Nijm of Yobi Partners and Steve Castle of ABC Investors, also joined this round. Co-founded by serial entrepreneur Roei Samuel, Connectd aims to ‘break down barriers’ in early-stage funding by using smart matching technology to put data at the heart of startup investment. Since its launch in February 2020, Connectd has helped almost 100 businesses to raise capital, including an approx. €2.1 million Series A round in the Spring of 2021. Already using the platform are analysts from VCs including 8Roads, Octopus, Piton Capital and Second City Ventures, in addition to over 1000 angel investors, family offices and advisors. Founder Roei Samuel, who sold his first company, an e-sports venture called RealSport, to Gfinity in a multi-million-pound deal at the age of 26, said the pandemic had demonstrated the potential to shake up startup funding: “It is ironic that with all the leaps made by British businesses, the startup space itself has seen very little in the way of innovation. Having founded my own business before investing in startups, I have seen how difficult it is on both sides. If you do not move in traditional circles, it can be very difficult to get access to the capital and outside expertise needed to rapidly scale the business. Similarly, investors can waste hours hopelessly searching for the right opportunity. We see it differently, which is why Connectd brings people together based on what they know, not who they know.”	<triplet> Connectd <sub> €841K <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> LiFE Ventures <sub> €841K <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Nigel Wray <sub> €841K <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Toni Nijm <sub> €841K <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Steve Castle <sub> €841K <obj> INVESTS

Sunlight will use the funding to expand its commercial operations and footprint, particularly in the US market. As businesses increasingly rely upon data-intensive applications like analytics, big data and artificial intelligence to run their core business processes, Sunlight’s technology can cut the infrastructure costs of running these applications by 70%. The Sunlight team explains that, despite significant advances in storage and networking hardware, existing cloud and virtualisation technologies are not architected to support the massive levels of throughput necessary, and are too bloated to run in resource-constrained edge environments. This results in large overinvestments in IT infrastructure, and failed cloud migrations. Sunlight assures that with 3 times more data forecasted to be created over the next 5 years than it did in the last 5, and 75% of data collection moving to the edge, their technology will become increasingly mission critical.	<triplet> Sunlight <sub> €4.9 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> OpenOcean <sub> €4.9 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Robert Bosch Venture Capital <sub> €4.9 million <obj> INVESTS

The funding will be used by Koto to acquire its first 50,000 users, train its AI credit risk systems, expand operational capacity, refine its UK marketing, and grow its team. Koto’s customers are typically excluded by big banks because they have “inconsistent income” (freelancers or the self employed, for example), are new to credit or the UK, or have a mark against their credit history. With the coronavirus pandemic heavily impacting many individuals’ finances, access to safe alternative sources of credit is arguably more important than ever.	<triplet> Koto <sub> €1.4 million <obj> RECEIVES

The London-based startup has just completed its Series A funding round of $3.3 million which was led by Mustard Seed and D-Ax. Food waste in the hospitality sector is a large and longstanding problem. Celebrity chefs Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall have both spoken out recently on this issue. They have invited supermarkets and the hospitality sector to drastically reduce the amount of waste they generate. 1/3 of all food worth $80bn+ is wasted annually. Winnow’s smart meter has calculated that it has already saved its customers $3m per annum. The company has worked with over 200 kitchens since launching in May 2013 – Compass Group, Accor Hotels, River Cottage Canteens, to mention some of them. These customers have seen a 30 – 60 % typical uplift in food profitability by reducing food costs. There is also a significant environmental benefit in reducing waste. Winnow have calculated that their clients are saving 850 tonnes of waste annually from landfill and prevent 3,600 tonnes of CO2 to be emissioned.	<triplet> Winnow <sub> $3.3 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Mustard Seed <sub> $3.3 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> D-Ax <sub> $3.3 million <obj> INVESTS

The funding for this previously 100% bootstrapped company was led by Novator Ventures, with participation from Burda Principal Investments and General Catalyst. Founders and angel investors including Ilkka Paananen (CEO, Supercell), Miki Kuusi (CEO, Wolt) and Matt Mullenweg (CEO, Automattic) also joined the round. Technology is evolving rapidly, and for every new development and opportunity, it seems there is also a new threat. Rapid digitalisation has alsoaccelerated the adoption of devices and platforms that allow data to be shared more widely than ever, and society now has a hungry appetite for online interconnected technologies and networks. Further, with an increase in remote working, consumers and businesses are now exposed to heightened cyber risks as the enterprise security perimeter blurs, and internet infrastructure is struggling to keep space. According to Nord, it is thought that cybercrime will cost the global economy a staggering $10.5 trillion by 2025, and nearly half of consumers now expect to be hacked. It is clear that to protect consumers, businesses and the broader digital economy in the long-term, a more holistic approach to online security is required.	<triplet> Nord Security <sub> €91.6 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Novator Ventures <sub> €91.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Burda Principal Investments <sub> €91.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> General Catalyst <sub> €91.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Founders <sub> €91.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> angel investors <sub> €91.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Ilkka Paananen <sub> €91.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Miki Kuusi <sub> €91.6 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Matt Mullenweg <sub> €91.6 million <obj> INVESTS

4016	Fitbay.com raises $2 million for personalised clothes discovery	Fitbay, the discovery platform that solves the problem of buying clothes online in the wrong size or style, has closed a $2 million seed funding round, lead by New York-based Steadfast Venture Capital and Stockholm-based VC firm, Creandum. This $2 million investment comes just 6 months after Fitbay closed an angel round with Jesper Buch (Founder of Just-Eat) and Creandum. The latest funding will be used to grow both the product team in Copenhagen and the commercial team in New York, and to develop the product and available features even further. This announcement also coincides with the launch of Fitbay’s new iOS app, which allows users to share pictures of themselves with their network of ‘body doubles’, and actually see how items of clothing fit other people with a similar body shape and size to their own. The idea behind Fitbay: The Danish startup wants to remove the “will-it-will not-it fit experience” from online clothes shopping by only showing users clothes that will fit their unique size and shape. Fitbay does this by connecting users with similar body types and style preferences, sorting them into groups so that information on fit and particular brands can be shared with other users who have similar body shapes and tastes. This crowd-sourced feedback allows Fitbay to provide its users with a personalised feed of products that will both fit and flatter their unique body type – all without having to input measurements. Users can also follow their ‘body doubles’, sharing tips and inspiration with others who will have similar experiences with the style, fit and sizing of different brands.	<triplet> Fitbay <sub> $2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Steadfast Venture Capital <sub> $2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Creandum <sub> $2 million <obj> INVESTS

The Berlin-based startup Wind Mobility, which specialises in e-scooter and e-bike rentals, has just received €19.2 million in a seed round from investors including HV Holtzbrinck Ventures and the Chinese VC Source Code Capital. This comes on the heels of the Swedish e-scooter startup VOI’s fundraising round of €43 million earlier this week.

As with other other e-scooter startups, users can unlock, park, and pay for Wind’s dockless scooters through its app, with prices starting from €1 per use. Though safety has emerged as an issue with scooters potentially clashing with pedestrians, Wind says it will work closely with public officials to keep its service safe, and reminds its users to avoid obstructing public sidewalks when parking. Unlike VOI, Wind uses replaceable batteries in its scooters. This way the scooters do not need to be collected at night and charged externally, reducing maintenance costs. The startup also plans to use IoT technology to update its scooters remotely.	<triplet> HV Holtzbrinck Ventures <sub> €19.2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Source Code Capital <sub> €19.2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Wind Mobility <sub> €19.2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> VOI <sub> €43 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Tier Mobility <sub> €25 million <obj> RECEIVES

The startup will use the funds to debut its sports wearable product ‘NURVV Run’, as well as research and develop into its patented bio-mechanics sensor tech. NURVV, founded in 2016, aims to give everyone the power to understand what their bodies are truly capable of, to find their true potential. Frustrated by ‘post-run’ data shown on smart watches, and not knowing how to apply this in the next run, husband and wife team Jason Roberts and Ulrica Lundqvist decided to find a solution. After 12 months of research and development using core bio-mechanical principles, they came up with a new sensor technology. The result was NURVV Run – a smart shoe insole and app that coaches runners in real time. Today, as one of the most sophisticated wearable running technology on the market, it uses 32 sensors to capture data from the feet at 1,000 times a second, per sensor. More accurate than a GPS watch, it analyses this data and provides runners with insights on performance at the same time as running. This tech allows runners to not only improve technique, but also prevent injury.	<triplet> NURVV <sub> €8.2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Hiro Capital <sub> €8.2 million <obj> INVESTS

Elodie Abécassis, founder of I MAKE, explains:“I am convinced that the “Make versus Buy” is the new way of consumption. Making rather than buying is, in my opinion, a lifestyle which goes far beyond the creative hobby. However, I find that it is sometimes difficult to get supplies, and that it happens very often to go to 3 different shops for a single project. That is why I decided to create I MAKE, and propose a website that gathers all the supplies in the same place but also shares tips and inspirations to make everything by yourself”.	<triplet> MAKE <sub> €1.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Eutopia <sub> €1.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Kima Ventures <sub> €1.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> private investors <sub> €1.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Thibaud Hug de Larauze <sub> €1.5 million <obj> INVESTS

Vickers Venture Partners, a top-ranked global early stage Venture Capital company, led the round and Dr. Finian Tan, Chairman of Vickers Venture Partners, will join the Emergex Board as a non-executive director. Founded in 2016, Emergex focuses on developing vaccines that prevent virulent diseases such as Zika, Dengue Fever, Ebola and even pandemic Flu. The company’s set-point vaccines deliver experimentally-derived pathogen peptide data via quantum-sized nanoclusters to prime the immune system to recognise subsequent infections, mimicking natural infection and preventing severe manifestation of the disease. Emergex’s T-cell vaccines elicit different responses than traditional antibody-producing vaccines, eliminating allergic, autoimmune or antibody-mediated side effects. Emergex’s underlying platform technology enables rapid development of vaccines to entire families of pathogens, compared to traditional approaches that can take years to develop and scale vaccines for single pathogens. As purely synthetic vaccines with no biological components, Emergex’s vaccines are much safer as they carry no infection risk from live attenuated pathogens, are much cheaper to produce since they do not require culturing, and can be conveniently transported and administered even in remote parts of the world as they can be stored and handled at room temperature.	<triplet> Vickers Venture Partners <sub> €9.9 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Emergex <sub> €9.9 million <obj> RECEIVES

Rebank’s digital platform combines all of a company’s bank accounts into a single view. By connecting existing banks to Rebank, a company can speed through their banking workflow and understand where they are making and spending money in real-time. They can also send money anywhere in a few clicks. The product was built to address the two main issues faced by companies today; unintuitive interfaces and complicated payments.

927	London-based Cado Security nabs €8.3 million for its cloud-native digital forensics platform	Cado Security, provider of the one of the first and only cloud-native digital forensics platform, today announced that it closed an approx. €8.3 million in Series A funding, bringing the company’s total capital raised to around €9.6 million. Led by Blossom Capital with participation from existing investors including Ten Eleven Ventures, the new funding comes only six months after the company closed its seed round, due to the significant demand for its platform. The new capital will be used to accelerate Cado Security’s growth through the expansion of key functions including engineering, customer support and go-to-market operations. According to Gartner, nearly 70% of enterprises plan to accelerate spending in cloud services in 2021. As more data moves to the cloud, attacks on cloud infrastructures are increasing significantly, putting new pressures on security teams to respond quickly. When a cyber incident occurs in the cloud today, forensic analysts spend countless days using a patchwork of rudimentary tools to manually collect and process the data needed for an investigation. “Over the past year, enterprises have compressed their cloud adoption timelines while protecting the applications that enable their remote workforces,”said Imran Ghory, partner at Blossom Capital. “Yet as high-profile breaches like SolarWinds illustrate, the complexity of cloud environments makes rapid investigation and response extremely difficult since security analysts typically are not trained as cloud experts. Cado Security solves for this with an elegant solution that automates time-consuming tasks like capturing forensically sound cloud data so security teams can move faster and more efficiently. The opportunity to help Cado Security scale rapidly is a terrific one for Blossom Capital.”	<triplet> Blossom Capital <sub> €8.3 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Cado Security <sub> €8.3 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Ten Eleven Ventures <sub> €8.3 million <obj> INVESTS 
1292	Zurich-based confidential data platform Decentriq raises €3.2 million	Swiss startup Decentriq, an enterprise data security expert, today announces an approx. €3.2 million seed round, led by btov Partners, with significant participation from Paladin Capital Group and existing investor Atlantic Labs. The investment is intended to drive international growth and to widen its client base. Founded in 2018, Decentriq minimizes the time and cost for enterprises to establish and maintain sensitive data ecosystems, e.g. when two entities want to share data. As business models increasingly rely on big data, a major challenge for enterprises is to be able to access and analyze sensitive data at scale and in a secure environment. At the same time, data owners should be able to decide who uses their data and how. Currently, this is only possible through legal contracts or partly by minimizing the value of the data through anonymization and aggregation. Decentriq’s cloud-based platform enables enterprises to access sensitive data – which falls under GDPR or is strategically important – in a confidential and protected environment. Organisations can also apply external machine learning models to their internal datasets. This enables organizations to manage, analyze and share their data within minutes, without needing to trust a third party, and in compliance with privacy requirements as the data is also encrypted while being in use.	<triplet> Decentriq <sub> €3.2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Paladin Capital Group <sub> €3.2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> btov Partners <sub> €3.2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Atlantic Labs <sub> €3.2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Decentriq <sub> €3.2 million <obj> RECEIVES

1557	Belgium-based e-peas nabs €8 million to make the world run battery-free	Belgian startup e-peas, a supplier of advanced energy harvesting solutions, has just completed its latest funding round of €8 million. The funding round was led by Partech and Airbus Ventures, with KBC Focus Fund, W.IN.G, Noshaq Ventures, LeanSquare, Nivelinvest and Vives also contributing. In the future, society will need to shift towards energy sources that have less ecological impact. Tens of billions of connected IoT and edge computing devices are now starting to be deployed and activity will keep on ramping up in the decades ahead. Reliance on disposable batteries in this context is simply impractical – with heavy network maintenance costs being incurred (as depleted batteries will need replacing periodically), along with huge damage to the environment. e-peas (2014) is uniquely positioned within this sector, serving as a one stop shop for customers’ energy harvesting requirements and enabling their hardware to be powered indefinitely. The company is successfully addressing opportunities in industrial, home/building automation, agriculture, health monitoring, smart metering and other sectors. Over the last 3 years, it has been continually broadening the scope of its Ambient Energy Manager (AEM) product line. This now covers solar, thermal, vibration and RF methods for extracting energy from IoT devices’ surroundings – thereby making them completely energy autonomous. The imminent introduction of ultra-low power processing and sensing solutions will bolster the e-peas portfolio still further.	<triplet> e-peas <sub> €8 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Partech <sub> €8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Airbus Ventures <sub> €8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> KBC Focus Fund <sub> €8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> W.IN.G <sub> €8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Noshaq Ventures <sub> €8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> LeanSquare <sub> €8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Nivelinvest <sub> €8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Vives <sub> €8 million <obj> INVESTS

This trend is already very visible in countries such as the US. But even in Belgium, there are several agencies – including a few newcomers – who have high ambitions with this approach.

The round was led by Seraphim Capital, the world’s first venture fund dedicated to SpaceTech, Vaekstfonden, the Danish state’s investment fund, and Angel Investor, Helge Munk. The spacetech sector is gaining evermore traction, as more industries start to look towards space to solve significant challenges, from worldwide connectivity, to data provision to solve environmental issues. However, a rapid increase in the number of satellites in orbit over the next few years will bring challenges of its own. Considering the number of communication satellites in use today, the levels of radiofrequency (RF) interference are increasing year on year. If not managed properly the accelerating growth of the satcom industry will drown the radio spectrum in RF-interference, reducing bandwidth and causing connection breakouts. Poorly performing and inaccurate ground antennas are the main source of RF-interference. For antenna research and development, and for approval to bring new antennas to market, access to testing is essential.	<triplet> QuadSAT <sub> €2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Seraphim Capital <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Vaekstfonden <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Helge Munk <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS

Other investors includeLatécoère. Innovating at the intersection of aviation and healthcare, Caeli Nova was founded in 2018 with the aim to improve human safety and performance via the application of medical science. The young company has developed and patented new breathing technology that improves oxygenation in challenging environments – such as when at altitude. The inspiration for the company came as one of the founders was taking a flight from Hong Kong to Europe and found that the aircraft was not taking the most direct flight. After talking to the captain, it was uncovered that pilots are required to follow routes that allow for rapid descent to a safe altitude in the rare event of an emergency decompression due to limiting factors in the aircraft’s oxygen system. This means that aircraft are frequently avoiding more direct routes to avoid high terrain routes and compensate for oxygen systems.	<triplet> Caeli Nova <sub> €7.7 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> LG Capital <sub> CaeliNova <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Ornament Health <sub> CaeliNova <obj> INVESTS

2176	London-based quantum machine learning startup Rahko raises €1.5 million in seed funding round	Founded in 2018 by Leonard Wossnig, Edward Grant, Miriam Cha and Ian Horobin, London-based quantum machine learning company Rahko is building ‘quantum discovery’ capabilities for chemical simulation to enable advances in batteries, chemicals, advanced materials and drugs. The startup has now raised a €1.5 million in a seed round led by Balderton Capital. Also participating in the round were venture firm AI Seed and angel investors Charles Songhurst (former Microsoft Head of Corporate Strategy), Tom McInerney (Founder, TGM Ventures), John Spindler (CEO, Capital Enterprise) and James Field (CEO, LabGenius). Chemical simulation is a vital capability that has not advanced significantly in recent years due to the limited computational power of classical computers – even the world’s largest supercomputers. With the Rahko quantum machine learning software platform and joint research with some of the world’s largest companies, Rahko is building an arsenal of tools that may make quantum computers accessible and commercially usable at an accelerated pace, often through the use of hybrid approaches with classical computers.	<triplet> Rahko <sub> €1.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Balderton Capital <sub> €1.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> AI Seed <sub> €1.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Charles Songhurst <sub> €1.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Tom McInerney <sub> €1.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> John Spindler <sub> €1.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> James Field <sub> €1.5 million <obj> INVESTS

Snowplow data is collected in real-time, and is rich and granular, meaning it can inform a wide range of functions within a business, such as customer journey optimisation, marketing attribution and operational reporting; Snowplow is also widely used to build data products. Snowplow already has over 150 customers across a broad range of sectors and geographies, including Strava, La Presse The Economist, Weebly, Hudl, Auto Trader, Omio and Secret Escapes. Auto Trader replaced its home-grown platform with the Snowplow product; La Presse powers its real-time marketing automation with Snowplow data.	<triplet> Snowplow Analytics <sub> €4.7 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> VC MMC Ventures <sub> €4.7 million <obj> INVESTS

DappRadar tracks over 2,500 dapps across six blockchains, including Ethereum, EOS and TRON, with plans to expand to others. DappRadar filters through dapp data, removes fake and irrelevant activity and provides actionable market intelligence. Dapps are tracked in terms of their active users, token volume and transaction activity to provide insight into the trends in the dapp ecosystem.

Plus, Preply’s global supply of tutors means that if you are in Berlin, for example, and want to learn Japanese, you can easily find a language expert at a time and price point that is convenient for you. This solves the ‘rush hour challenge’ that occurs with live teaching, as most learners prefer taking classes before or after work, which means that there are limited number of slots or tutors available. To date, two million classes have been taken on Preply, with teachers of 160 nationalities. The vast majority of learners are using Preply for professional purposes such as moving abroad or to advance their careers. Others are using it recreationally, such as helping their child learn a new language, for example, or indulging a passion to master a new skill.	<triplet> Preply <sub> €9 million <obj> RECEIVES

3214	GetYourGuide raises $75 million to further expand its global marketplace for travel activities	GetYourGuide, the largest online booking platform for travel activities, today announced it has closed a $75 million Series D funding round led by Battery Ventures, a global technology-focused investment firm. All of GetYourGuide’s existing venture partners have joined the funding round – including KKR, Spark Capital, Highland Europe, Sunstone Capital and Nokia Growth Partners (NGP). The Berlin-based company will apply the fresh capital toward international expansion and technological development. This way, GetYourGuide will strengthen its position as the global market leader for tours, activities and attractions. The funding comes at a time of unprecedented momentum for GetYourGuide, which this summer crossed the threshold of 10 million tickets booked, with nearly half of those booked in 2017 alone. The in-destination activities segment of the global tourism industry, which now represents a $135 billion market and accounts for 10% of global leisure travel revenue, is growing at a similar clip: recent estimates project that the global market for tours and activities will reach $183 billion by 2020, and that online bookings within the segment will more than double from 2015 levels. Johannes Reck, the CEO of GetYourGuide, who also spoke at our EU-Startups Conference 2016, stated: “We are experiencing explosive growth this year and have stepped up to become the largest online booking platform for travel activities. It is our goal to significantly disrupt the in-destination travel experience in the years ahead, and the financing we have raised from both new and existing investors represents a vote of confidence in our progress toward capturing the massive market opportunity before us.”	<triplet> GetYourGuide <sub> $75 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Battery Ventures <sub> $75 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> KKR <sub> $75 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Spark Capital <sub> $75 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Sunstone Capital <sub> $75 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Nokia Growth Partners <sub> $75 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Highland Europe <sub> $75 million <obj> INVESTS

This investment helps conclude a landmark year for the long-term rental startup after successfully expanding to 35 cities across eight European countries and Australia. Customer experience is really big issue in the business of online rental. nestpick recently stated: “This market has become rife for scammers!”. The startup did a survey earlier this year to find out the real situation.It was conducted by asking over 500 people of all age groups from all over the world 14 comprehensive questions regarding their experiences with online rental scams. Most respondents fall into the Generation Y category with 55.8% aged between 22 and 25 and 28% aged between 18 and 21. Around a third of participants responded that they either know someone who has been scammed (31.3%) or have themselves been victims of online rental fraud in the past (22.8%). The issue is no rarity and has become a reality of renting online, with almost three quarters of the participants (73.8%) responding they are concerned that they will become victims when looking for their next home. Venture Village doubted earlier this year whether so fast growing platform can really verify all nests as it promises in their statements. In this case, verification means a nestpick photographer visits the apartment, takes pictures and ensures its existence and quality. Nestpick started in April 2014 in the Netherlands and was acquired by the company builder Rocket Internet in December the same year. The startup then moved to Berlin, launching in cities in the YOU.K., France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Ireland, and Austria.	<triplet> nestpick <sub> $2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Target Global <sub> $2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> b-to-vPartners <sub> $2 million <obj> INVESTS

1200	Swedish startup Alloverse lands €250k to launch open-source VR platform for virtual collaboration	Alloverse, a Swedish VR startup developing an open-source platform for virtual collaboration, has closed their pre-seed round at €250K. The startup has an ambitious mission of building the future of the 3D internet by keeping their technology open, and growing a global community of VR/AR enthusiasts. The idea of the Alloverse was sparked in Nevyn Bengtsson’s mind in December 2016, when he realised that it was not possible to be productive in VR. One could play games, but there was no software infrastructure for building productivity apps. Two years later, whilst watching a Oculus Connect 5 Keynote, Nevyn felt that humanity was on the cusp of a revolution. One where AR headsets could eventually replace smartphones, where 2D user interfaces could take the place of text-based terminal interfaces, and 3D UIs could replace all every-day computing. This dream became reality in January 2020, when he joined forces with Julie Despraz, Tobias Kask, Patrik Sjöberg and Emma Koszinowski. The VR industry has exploded over the last 12 months, as people have been looking for new ways to divert themselves and discover the power of immersive technologies. The adoption of this tech poised not just to replace physical collaboration, but to improve on it. Current big players in the collaborative VR space such as Spatial, Glue and MeetinVR offer competent, polished applications for corporate training or meetings in VR. However, these solutions all share the common downside of being proprietary, meaning they are not only incompatible with each other, but also impossible to extend with custom components.	<triplet> Alloverse <sub> €250K. <obj> RECEIVES

3519	ParkBee secures €1.8 million, makes car parks available all day long, and expands in UK	Company car parks usually stand empty outside of normal working hours. That is the reason why Amsterdam-based ParkBee is making office building car park spaces accessible to the public in cooperation with the parking apps Parkmobile and Park-line. ParkBee just got the capital injection of €1.8 million from four informal investors and InnovationQuarter – the regional development agency for province of South Holland. The investment will speed up international expansion namely in UK. The startup was founded in 2014 by Chinese entrepreneur Jian Jiang and UK entrepreneur Tom Buchmann, who lived as an expat in the Netherlands and is now active in the UK with the English expansion. Since its launch in October 2015 Parkbee has experienced rapid growth in Netherlands: 34 company car parks with a total of 1800 parking spaces have already signed up to its smart technology. ParkBee is generating a new source of income for property owners. Motorists enjoy an attractive rate compared to the well-known commercial car parks, and they do not need to spend as much time looking for a parking space. They can easily open the barrier with the parking app and then park safely in the garage. Municipalities also experience less parking pressure, which means that, for example, fewer large-scale investments in underground car parks are required.	<triplet> ParkBee <sub> €1.8 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> InnovationQuarter <sub> €1.8 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> informal investors <sub> €1.8 million <obj> INVESTS

With this investment, we will be able to revolutionize additional industries and in the end, enable better and more sustainable products. I am truly happy that Industrifonden and Fairpoint Capital want to be a part of our journey.” The company currently has around 25 paying customers, primarily within architecture and building construction, which has been their first market to entry. They are helping leading companies such as White, Sweco, Vasakronan, and Thyréns simulate wind in urban environments.

Having secured about $3.8 million in growth funding from Mobeus Equity Partners, the young company plans to accelerate the uptake of its digital preservation software which is already in use at over 100 large and small corporate and public sector organizations, including the Associated Press (AP), Yale University, New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), BT and HSBC. Demand for Preservica’s software, which protects and future-proofs digital information, is being driven by the need to keep digital information for longer for compliance, legal defense, and knowledge reuse. Digital content is often fragile and can be easily lost – or worse – stored in formats that become obsolete and cannot be used. Preservica’s unique active digital preservation software addresses this challenge head on; ensuring digital content is not just securely stored, but also automatically translated into formats that can be used and read by future applications and technologies.	<triplet> Preservica <sub> $3.8 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Mobeus Equity Partners <sub> $3.8 million <obj> INVESTS

The funding round was also joined by prominent business angels like Ajay Vashee (CFO at Dropbox), Carlos Gonzales-Cadenaz (COO of GoCardless), Felix Jahn (founder of McMakler), Matt Robinson (founder of GoCardless and Nested) and Max Tayenthal (co-founder of N26). The German startup set out to make the process of creating and managing complex, business-critical spreadsheets workflows simple and efficient. While businesses are heavily reliant on spreadsheets for critical processes such as financial planning, reporting and forecasting, they are often fragile, breaking easily and requiring highly paid employees to spend hours on repetitive, mundane tasks, managing contributions over emails and copy-pasting between files. At best, this leads to a frustrating experience and at worst, the data that the business relies on is lost or inaccurate. Layer allows spreadsheet users to request data and input from colleagues and give granular access down to individual cells, improving collaboration and overall productivity. The web app can be used within seconds without any additional plugins or installations and sits on top of your existing Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets files. Currently in private beta, users can register for early access on golayer.io. Layer is expected to launch publicly in 2021.	<triplet> Layer <sub> €5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Index Ventures <sub> €5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> btov Partners <sub> €5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Ajay Vashee <sub> €5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> CarlosGonzales-Cadenaz <sub> €5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Felix Jahn <sub> €5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Matt Robinson <sub> €5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Max Tayenthal <sub> €5 million <obj> INVESTS

The fresh capital will be used to start the international expansion soon. Home insurance is a €100 billion industry in Europe, but its opaque terms and conditions, multi-stage and elongated processes and ‘guilty before proven innocent’ approach to claims have eroded consumers’ trust. On average, after the experience of making a home insurance claim, 40% of consumers choose to change provider. In addition, the industry has been slow to embrace technology and move online, failing to provide the experiences consumers have come to expect from other services. Founded in 2017 in Paris by Raphael Vullierme and Benoit Bourdel, Luko has customer service at its heart, providing simple, transparent insurance and fast home repair. Its online platform set out to transform the insurance experience: it takes two minutes to obtain coverage, two hours to receive payment for a claim and two days for damage to be repaired.

The startup has just announced that it is being funded by the National Center for Research and Development with €6.7 million for its PureBIKE project to create an immuno-oncological drug to treat triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Triple-negative breast cancer is a a rare and particularly aggressive form of breast cancer, with a poorer prognosis than other types. Unlike other forms of breast cancer, the triple-negative type is not driven by the hormones estrogen and progesterone, nor by the HER2 protein, and so does not respond to hormonal therapies. So far, scientists have not managed to develop a therapy specifically for TNBC – current treatment options are currently limited to destructive chemotherapy. The PureBIKE project aims to develop a new drug using Pure Biologics’ PureSelect platform for the selection of new antibodies.	<triplet> Pure Biologics <sub> €6.7 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> National Center for Research and Development <sub> €6.7 million <obj> INVESTS

The funding was led by OpenOcean with participation from Earlybird Digital East which led Binalyze’s pre-seed round last year. Cybercrime is one of the primary concerns for enterprises in the digital age. It is claimed that over half of large companies now deal with hundreds, if not thousands, of cybersecurity alerts every day. It is now becoming accepted that 100% breach prevention is no longer a realistic expectation for most businesses. Traditional digital forensic tools are slow and require technical knowledge that is in short supply – meaning it can take weeks, or even months, for an enterprise the understand the full extent of a cyber breach. Cyberthreats, though, require a speedy response. This is where Binalyze is targeting its focus – redefining how enterprises respond to cyber security breaches.	<triplet> Binalyze <sub> €9.1 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> OpenOcean <sub> €9.1 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Earlybird Digital East <sub> €9.1 million <obj> INVESTS

Co-founder Hughes said:“During our research we spoke with hundreds of teams who were struggling to move quickly because of the limitations of their data infrastructure. The teams making the most progress were having to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, across separate solutions, to help them get their data under control and it was taking them up to 12-18 months to purchase and implement it all.”	<triplet> LocalGlobe <sub> €2.2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Count <sub> €2.2 million <obj> RECEIVES
