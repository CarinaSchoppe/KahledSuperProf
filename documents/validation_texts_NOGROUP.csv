1634	Estonian proptech Moderan snaps up €270K for its property management software	Today Tallinn-based startupModeran, a lease and commercial property management software, has snapped up €270K funding to expand its solutions to German-speaking markets, the Czech Republic, and Russia. A significant part of the investment was made by the real estate company Zenith Family Office, and their investors, as well as the Lemonade Stand fund. Founded in 2015, Moderan aims to help commercial real estate owners go digital, and professionally manage their commercial real estate and tenant relations. Its lease lifecycle management and asset reporting tool helps owners optimise their organisation, save time and money, and increases the value of their holdings. So far the startup has both Baltic and German companies onside, such as Rotermann City, Lumi Capital, New Hanza Capital, Workland, YIT, among others, and is seeing the crisis as an opportunity for expansion.“The clear value of today’s crisis has been the transfer of sales into digital channels. Even in markets as complex as Germany, the attitude of customers has changed overnight. All the meetings that we planned to have in Berlin then simply happened via video calls. There was a clear breakthrough on the German market, and several new customers joined us in a short time,”said Kristi Hakkaja, CEO and founder of Moderan. Moderan’s solution provides a comprehensive overview of the entire real estate portfolio: assets, spaces, contracts, deadlines and terms. Additionally, a new feature was added for the automated calculation of incidental costs at the beginning of 2020, which is one of the most time-consuming and complex processes in the real estate business. The company’s experience shows that, when starting to use Moderan, even the most experienced Excel fans discover several errors they have made, not to mention potential losses up to the amount of tens of thousands in the case of major mistakes.Today, Moderan manages more than 350 buildings and assets worth more than a billion euros. Moderan is best suited for owners of commercial real estate or a mixed portfolio, managing high-value assets, such as business campuses, shopping malls, and technology parks.	<triplet> Zenith Family Office <sub> €270K <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Lemonade Stand fund <sub> €270K <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Moderan <sub> €270K <obj> RECEIVES 
1731	Hyper Poland nabs €500K to develop magnetic levitation railways in Europe	TodayHyper Poland, aninnovative Polish transport startup that we already have had our eye on,has smashed its equity fundraising target of €451K and raised more than half a million euros via a successfulcampaign on Seedrs. The funds will help the company to extend its research on passive magnetic levitation technology, adapting it to existing railway infrastructure and building a full-scale test track. Hyper Poland, founded in 2015, is working on hyperloop-inspired solutions as an upgrade for the railway industry. Their idea is to introduce a commercial magnetic railway capable of speeds up to 300 km/h, based on magnetic levitation, linear motor and autonomous control systems. This impressive technology can be transformed into a vacuum system hyperrail hitting a top speed of 600 km/h. The team has already previously raised around €4 million to date, and was a Finalist in the prestigious StartUp Europe Awards 2017. So how does it work? Hyper Poland has divided the process into three stages. The first, called ‘Magrail’, will consist of pilot projects introducing passive magnetic levitation in the next 3 years. In this pilot, magnetic vehicles will reach the speed of 415 km/h on existing, modernized infrastructure, not eliminating regular train connections. Less funding will be required to adjust existing infrastructure in this step, than constructing a new high-speed railway.	<triplet> Seedrs <sub> €451K <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Hyper Poland <sub> €451K <obj> RECEIVES

3350	Codecool coding school boosts expansion abroad	PortfoLion has just invested €2 million in Codecool to boost its international expansion. Through this capital injection the Hungarian coding school can continue its growth in the most promising segment of the educational services market. The IT labour shortage in Hungary is currently estimated at 22.000 people, and this figure approaches 1 million in the EU as a whole. Experts agree that the problem of the recruitment of IT specialists is an existing, and probably long-term phenomenon. A qualified IT labour force has become the most important factor in the future success and business growth of enterprises not only in Hungary but globally, too. Recognizing this trend early on, in 2015 a group of Hungarian private individuals founded the Codecool IT specialist training company, which at the moment operates educational centres in Budapest (HU), Miskolc (HU) and Krakow (PL). Now in four grades, currently more than 300 students are taught programming as well as other skills ensuring their successful placement within the profession. During the Codecool course made up of 12 months of theoretical, and 6 months of practical elements, primarily 18-40-year-old career starters, or those switching careers, without any previous IT qualifications, are taught programming in coordination with the employer market, thereby guaranteeing graduates a job at the successful conclusion of the course. In addition to traditional secondary and higher education, this model supplies a high volume of recruits, which can be adjusted to specific corporate demands. The guarantee of a job and the post-financed training model are particularly attractive factors for applicants.	<triplet> PortfoLion <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Codecool <sub> €2 million <obj> RECEIVES

1048	Brussels-based Soda raises €11.5 million to bring everyone closer to data	Belgian startupSodaannounced today that it has raised €11.5 million in a Series A round to accelerate the development of its data monitoring platform, which streamlines how teams find data worth fixing. The round was led by leading European venture investor, Singular, with returning participation from seed investors Point Nine Capital, Hummingbird Ventures, DCF and angel investors. According toGartner’s Data Quality Market Survey, the average financial impact of bad data on organisations in 2017 was estimated to be around $15 million (€12.4 million) per year. This is because people across any business (such as data engineers, developers, data scientists, managers, senior executives) are all exposed to data, and use it as part of their roles every day. If data is incomplete or damaged, the time taken to correct the data is both time-consuming and costly. For Soda, maintaining data quality is a team sport that means everyone who has a stake in the data – and that is everyone in the business – needs to understand it, trust it, and stay on top of it. Soda’s mission is to bring everyone closer to trusted data. Raffi Kamber, General Partner at lead investor, Singular, said, “Analysis and usage of data has become business critical in most applications. Data quality needs to be preserved everywhere in a modern data stack, which is becoming increasingly massive and complex. A natural need has thus emerged for a platform that monitors data and provides a unified view of the data and its issues to all the stakeholders. That is what Soda is about, and Maarten and Tom bring deep expertise on this issue to the industry, their partners and customers.”	<triplet> startupSodaannounced <sub> €11.5 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Singular <sub> €11.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Point Nine Capital <sub> €11.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Hummingbird Ventures <sub> €11.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> DCF <sub> €11.5 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> angel investors <sub> €11.5 million <obj> INVESTS

The funding will allow Moodwork to reach companies across the whole of Europe and tackle new sectors. Moodwork, founded in 2017, offers employees tools both on desktop and mobile that measure their quality of work life. After analysing their current state of being, Moodwork offers personalised content, including psychologists, coaches, video tutorials and webinars, available to improve any aspects of working life that are not up to par. With a user-centric approach, employees are put in charge of managing their own wellbeing, creating a sense of self-autonomy. They are first encouraged to analyse their current state of mind with a series of questions, such as“Do I get on well with my manager?”, “Are his/her decisions fair or unfair?” “Do I feel pessimistic lately?”, “Am I Tired?”. The tips shown to each employee are subsequently adjusted according to each person’s individual feedback. Employees most at risk, scoring below 40/100 in the well-being balance, are“invited to get in touch with professionals and thus avoid the risk of sick leave,” says Benjamin Brion, co-founder of Moodwork. For example, on a daily basis, employees can chat with experts through a chat box, run by four full-time employees. Most importantly, employees only receive general workforce reports and all data is anonymous, meaning that employees can feel comfortable being honest.	<triplet> Moodwork <sub> €2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Newfund <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS

1885	Ghent-based uman.ai raises €500K to map employees’ work skills	The Belgian startup uman.ai, whose software helps teams to share skills more efficiently,has just announced raising €500K. The round was led by imec.istart, Skyhaus (parent company of a.o. ML6) and Roel Naessens (ex-Google), and additionally, the startup received innovation grants from VLAIO. With the funds raised, uman.ai wants to develop its platform further and set up a high-performance go-to-market strategy. Uman.ai, founded in 2019, helps teams increase collaboration and share skills. The idea behind uman.ai came from the statistic that employees spend over 4.5 hours a week repeating mistakes that colleagues have already made. Companies possess a lot of knowledge distributed amongst their employees, but they lack the tools to make that knowledge visible. Uman.ai’s AI-driven knowledge platform, based on deep learning algorithms, that maps the skills of all employees in a company, creating a good overview of all knowledge and skills present on the work floor. Uman.ai is a solution that works out of the box, with no integrations required, meaning that any company can get started immediately. Co-founder Charles Boutens says:“Research shows that 30% of employee turnover is due to the poor match between the tasks and skills and personal interests of the employee. With our platform we want to make it possible for teams to share information more easily so that employees gain a greater insight into their own competences and thus develop new skills themselves”.	<triplet> uman.ai <sub> €500K. <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> imec.istart <sub> €500K. <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Skyhaus <sub> €500K. <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Roel Naessens <sub> €500K. <obj> INVESTS

2993	Amsterdam-based electric scooter startup felyx raises €3 million and expands to Rotterdam	The electric scooter startup felyx just raised €2 million in additional funding through a combination of private investors and the ABN AMRO bank. Earlier this year, felyx already raised €1 million to accelerate growth. Founded in 2016, thousands of users currently share the 108 electric scooters of felyx in Amsterdam. The combined funds will now be used to expand with the shared mobility concept to Rotterdam, where felyx will start with 324 e-scooters. The investment of additional €2 million is the decisive factor for expansion to Rotterdam, where earlier this year a letter of intent was signed by the city to introduce the concept. The first step for expansion was made early 2018, when €1 million was raised for the organizational growth of the company. That earlier investment was made by informal investors, of which Anne-Marie Rakhorst, entrepreneur and founder of the platform Duurzaamheid.nl, is one. Unlike Bird and LimeBike that offer stand-up scooters, Felyx offers larger electric ‘mopeds’ suitable for two people to drive. The dark green electric scooters are already part of the streetscape in Amsterdam. Consumers can easily rent the e-scooters through the felyx app for Apple and Android. Driving costs €0,30 per minute, and users do not have to worry about maintenance or parking spots for the vehicles.	<triplet> felyx <sub> €2 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> private investors <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> ABN AMRO bank <sub> €2 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> felyx <sub> €1 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Anne-MarieRakhorst <sub> €1 million <obj> INVESTS

2669	London-based cybersecurity startup Tessian raises €37 million in Series B funding led by Sequoia	London-based Tessian, a cybersecurity platform that is helping hundreds of enterprises around the world to radically reduce the chances of human security breaches, has raised €37 million in Series B funding. The round was led by Sequoia, with participation from Latitude and existing investors Balderton Capital and Accel. Tessian’s technology uses machine learning to eliminate the huge security vulnerabilities surrounding enterprise email, including spear phishing and misdirected emails. The platform analyses email data in order to understand the context of human relationships and communication. By knowing what normal email activity looks like, it can automatically detect any anomalies that may imply a security threat. Emails that look like security threats are flagged with warning notifications to employees, which alert them to the specific reason why something looks unusual. Security admins can also be notified in real-time when threats are detected and with information about what action the employee took when issued with the warning. “We have entered the third era of enterprise cybersecurity. In the early days, network security sufficed,” said Tim Sadler, CEO and co-founder of Tessian. “Then cloud apps and mobile devices proliferated, and we adopted endpoint protection. But in spite of these protections, data breaches are at an all-time high. The reason is humans. People are the most important decision makers in the enterprise and process extremely sensitive information on a daily basis, yet they are more vulnerable than ever before. Tessian’s mission is to help organisations protect people processing data using technology that empowers, rather than restricts the way they work.”	<triplet> Tessian <sub> €37 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Sequoia <sub> €37 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Latitude <sub> €37 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Balderton Capital <sub> €37 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Accel <sub> €37 million <obj> INVESTS

Prior to the current round, Monidor has been backed up by Butterfly Ventures and private investors. Founded in 2015, Monidor’s mission is to help clinicians in their work and improve patient safety with easy-to-use solutions.

The company launched its first product ‘Monidrop’ in February 2020, and is now receiving the funding to respond to the urgent need for safe patient monitoring solutions raised by Covid-19. Moreover, the new funds are directed to support the future growth of the company. The story of Monidor started when one of the co-founders, Antti Puolitaival, kept facing the consequences of inexact infusion in his daily work as a doctor. Currently, infusion therapy is often monitored manually, and thus is both inaccurate and needlessly overburdening the hospital staff. While practically similar devices to measure the infusion treatment have been developed earlier, they are overly expensive, significantly large in size, and traditionally only available for the intensive care patients.	<triplet> Monidor <sub> €1 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Innovestor <sub> €1 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Voima Ventures <sub> €1 million <obj> INVESTS

Cogo is changing the booming rideshare market and aims to take it even further with new funding. Their goal? To solve transparency and infrastructure issues while unleashing the full possibilities of shared mobility. The shared mobility market has explodeld in an incredibly short amount of time. According McKinsey & Company, it is now worth $7 billion (around €5.8 billion), and the value is projected to exceed $500 billion (around €420.5 billion) by 2030. You would be hard-pressed to ﬁnd many Europeans who have not heard of Voi, Tier, Bolt, Lime, ShareNow or Donkey Republic. Today, there are hundreds of rideshare operators across Europe, and there are probably just as many opinions about the booming trend. The rapid development has led to a fragmented market, where regulations and infrastructure cannot keep up, just as users have no transparency in price, availability or terms of service.

3451	Berlin-based zeotap raises €12M to help more companies with data onboarding for advertising targeting	zeotap, the data platform that we mentioned among “10 German startups to look out for in 2016“, today announced its Series B funding round of €12 million. The new investment reflects both zeotap’s achievements in telecom data onboarding for advertising targeting and measurement, and its potential to grow into the single platform that aggregates deterministic data across industries. Data is increasingly the cornerstone of the mobile advertising market and determines the efficiency of any buying or selling decision in the programmatic advertising ecosystem. At its inception in September 2014, zeotap aimed to leverage this trend by creating a global platform to effectively integrate deterministic data from different telecom operators. By using these telecom assets as a nucleus, zeotap has proven the efficacy and value of its data by achieving up to four times the average data price in the market. Simultaneously, Mozeo, zeotap’s Indian joint venture established a few months ago with local partner Mogaé Media, has reported strong progress. Mozeo aims to provide a unique solution that promises to comprehensively improve how advertising is bought and sold in India today. Headquartered in Berlin, zeotap has recently broadened its ambitions to other deterministic data sources that diversify its data graph while still adhering to the same quality standards. In just the last six months, the company has signed several contracts, including a global one with a leading security company as well as a top navigation services provider. For data buyers, the zeotap platform might become even more attractive with a variety of impactful data attributes, including socio-demographic, location, interest and even deterministic mobile purchase intent signals, available from a single trusted source.	<triplet> zeotap <sub> €12 million <obj> RECEIVES

4039	WhatsApp alternative Hoccer secures € 50M from Dirk Ströer	Hoccer, the “secure” WhatsApp alternative out of Germany, just received €50 million from Dirk Ströer (a wealthy German media entrepreneur). To be honest with you, this large investment, which grants Dirk Ströer 51% equity in the startup, was the first time I ever heard about Hoccer. But since the big acquisition deal between Facebook and WhatsApp, alternative messaging apps are very hot right now – especially when they claim to protect your data (keyword: NSA/Snowden). So what is the story behind Hoccer? Created by a small group of devel­op­ers, Hoccer’s first Android and IPhone version (Hoccer classic) launched in 2009. In 2010 the Berlin-based team incorporated the project and founded the Hoccer GmbH. After a major update of the app in December 2011 and the release of Hoccer XO in 2013, the young company counts over two million downloads so far. Nice to know: Hoccer’s end-to-end encryption technology ensures that only you and the intended receivers can decipher the message. Even Hoccer is not capable to read your messages. In addition, the encrypted information that you transfer to others stays on Hoccer’s servers only for the time until the recipient has received your message.	<triplet> Hoccer <sub> €50 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Dirk Ströer <sub> €50 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Hoccer <sub> €50 million <obj> RECEIVES

It was during this first venture that the founders of zenloop realised the detrimental retention issues faced by companies – both large and small.

2491	Paris-based fintech PIXPAY raises €3.1 million to launch its banking solution for teens	Founded just four months ago, the Paris-based fintech startup PIXPAY has raised €3.1 million in a round led by Global Founders Capital. With the funding, PIXPAY intends to reinvent the way teenagers manage their budgets and spend their money in an economy where cash is disappearing, and build a European banking solution specifically for 10 to 18-year-olds. Traditional banks do not serve the needs of minors, often offering little more than an ATM card. Therefore, many adolescents are still dependent on their families to give them cash to spend, but this is not practical for online purchases, and for parents, cash has some downsides, such as the risk of loss or theft. To solve this problem, three parents, Benoit Grassin, Nicolas Klein (co-founders of the startup MonDocteur, which was sold to Doctolib in July 2018) and Caroline Ménager, decided to create PIXPAY. Their mission is to digitise spending for teens and parents, and with 30 million teenagers in Europe today, there is a large potential market.	<triplet> PIXPAY <sub> €3.1 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Global Founders Capital <sub> €3.1 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> PIXPAY <sub> €3.1 million <obj> RECEIVES

Thanks to its digitisation tools, the startup is well-adapted to the crisis. Tristan Verdier, founder of Eventmaker says:“Faced with the threat of not being able to organize their shows, organisers are trying to keep them in a 100% online or hybrid format.

Reducing client churn and maximising client upselling are crucial parts of any B2B company, and ‘customer success’ has been gaining traction as a fundamental part of business operations. To succeed in this, businesses need to analyse and be aware of proper and accurate metrics. Traditionally, the Net Promoter Score has been the leading customer health metric. Lift is on a mission to disrupt this approach and wants to establish their ‘Lift Score’ as the new standard to measure, predict and improve customer health. NPS has been criticised as neglecting to consider the complexity of B2B relationships with multiple stakeholders and their different needs. To get insights, companies who can afford it, engage with large consultancies like PWC to get a yearly report on customer sentiment and suggested actions. But, in a rapidly moving world, yearly input does not cut it.	<triplet> Lift Relations ( Lift ) <sub> €2.6 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> SEED Capital <sub> €2.6 million <obj> INVESTS

837	Lithuania-based Interactio raises €24.4 million for its remote interpretation platform	Interactio, a leading remote interpretation platform, announces that it has raised around €24.4 million in Series A funding. This makes it one of the largest Series A rounds in the Baltics so far. The new investment comes from global VC firms Eight Roads Ventures (Alibaba, AppsFlyer and Neo4j among the portfolio companies) and Silicon Valley-based Storm Ventures (investors in Pipedrive and TalkDesk) with participation from Practica Capital, Notion Capital, and Change Ventures. Renowned angels also took part, such as Jaan Tallinn, one of the co-founders of Skype and Young Sohn, ex-Chief Strategy Officer of Samsung. This funding will support the exponential growth Interactio has realised during the pandemic, which has accelerated the demand for ‘Remote Interpretation Platforms’. Founded in 2014, Interactio works with the world’s largest institutions (e.g. European Parliament, European Commission, United Nations) and corporates (e.g. BMW, JP Morgan, Microsoft) to provide real-time multilingual interpretation services for remote or hybrid meetings. The platforms allow hosting participants and interpreters who can either be in the room or remote. With COVID acting as a catalyst, Interactio grew 12-fold between 2019 and 2020, while being profitable. The company hosted 18,000+ meetings with 390,000 listeners in 2020 alone in more than 70 countries.	<triplet> Interactio <sub> €24.4 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Eight Roads Ventures <sub> €24.4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Storm Ventures <sub> €24.4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Practica Capital <sub> €24.4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Notion Capital <sub> €24.4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Change Ventures <sub> €24.4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> angels <sub> €24.4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Jaan Tallinn <sub> €24.4 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Young Sohn <sub> €24.4 million <obj> INVESTS

Okredo’s SaaS platform helps SMEs assess the credibility, financial strength and sales potential of new and existing business partners and customers Dealing with delayed payments from customers gives SMEs difficult economic risks. These risks are then often exacerbated by a lack of financial literacy combined with a lack of affordable tools to manage them. Smaller companies are particularly exposed to delayed-payment risk, as they do not tend to have the budgets for expensive credit bureau reporting, human resources for in-house analysis, or financial training to sufficiently vet new and existing partners and customers. With the EU’s Open Data Directive going into effect this year, businesses and other enterprises in member states are now required to report on data points that range from debt loads to changes in the c-suite. While this data is technically now ‘open’ (a work that remains in slow progress), it is actually hosted in different agencies. Some of these agencies are private, and they are under to requirement or obligation to package the datasets in a way that is SME-friendly.	<triplet> Okredo <sub> €1 million <obj> RECEIVES  <triplet> Lithuanian Business Angels Fund <sub> €1 million <obj> INVESTS  <triplet> Presto Ventures <sub> €1 million <obj> INVESTS
